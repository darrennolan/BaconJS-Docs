# Bacon.js Docs
A singular (at present) effort to provide better docs for newcomers to Bacon.js, particularly around example snippets to help people onboard with the awesomesauce that is Bacon.js

As you explore more of Bacon.js you'll find the [API Reference](https://baconjs.github.io/api.html) an indispensable source of truth and wonder.

The documentation here is not to replace the official documentation.  It is a bias, community driven (me to nuts so I better write some stuff) introduction to Bacon.js with some specific examples on a per API basis.
